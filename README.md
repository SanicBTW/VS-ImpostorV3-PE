# Psych Engine 0.3.2h

# What is this?

This is another fork of Psych Engine 0.3.2h that I made to add Android compatibility and more features (because I like 0.3.2h a lot and shit is easier to port to HTML5)

This was originally a base for mod ports but a youtube comment on one of my videos showing a gameplay of one of my ports asked for a build of the OG game with this engine so I decided to do it

# Features

- Android compatibility ([Using M.A.Jigsaw Android Controls](https://github.com/MAJigsaw77/FNF-Android-Porting) though it uses an old version lol)
- Base Psych Stuff
- Camera movement on note direction
- Accuracy based on ms (Coming from 0.5.2h)
- Multiple inputs (I don't know if this is a good idea)
- Low memory usage (Apparently)
- A bunch of options to customize the engine (Might add more)
- Some sick features from PE 0.5.2h
- A really cool screen to ask for permissions (Storage Access to add songs and shit, hitsounds folder not working yet lol)
- A new loading screen (For HTML5 users)

# Pending

- Fix the reset score substate not destroying past control or resetting state as options state does

# Special thanks

HTML5 Players - For testing latest changes

Dulce - For beta testing the Android version <3
